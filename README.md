# Copy Paste VR/AR Experience - "RealityBridge"
Quickly prototype Virtual Reality scenes using AI Object Detection on the Qualcomm RB3 Gen 2 board.

Our ergonomic copy paste handheld tool allows the user to scan objects in the real world, detect and classify the scanned object, and send it to the virtual reality scene. As an added bonus, this device also keeps your hands warm in the cold! ‚ùÑ

Check out our [DevPost page](https://devpost.com/software/copy-paste-vr-ar-experience). This project was developed for the 2025 MIT Reality Hack event.

## Data Pipeline
* üì∑Qualcomm RB3 Gen 2 board scans the physical space like a handheld camera
* When the user presses the copy button, a serial message is sent from the ESP32 to the Qualcomm (USB-C to USB-A, baudrate 115200)
* üì∂The Qualcomm receives the copy signal and publishes the latest detected high-confidence object to the Redis server
* üìöWhen the user presses the paste button, the signal goes through the Qualcomm and into the Redis Server
* The VR Unity scene is subscribed to the Redis server and listens for the user's button presses
* üì¶When the paste signal is recieved, the Unity project takes the AI identified name and uses the SketchFab API to spawn a 3D model in Virtual Reality
* üé®This allows the user to rapidly prototype ideas in virtual reality 

## Getting Started
### How to get into Qualcomm RB3 Gen 2
* Plug in Qualcomm HDMI to USB-C
* Plug in Qualcomm USB-C to USB-A
* Use `usbipd` to see connected USB devices
* `usbipd bind --busid <bus number>` to bind the USB port
* `usbipd attach --busid <bus number> --wsl` to bind USB to WSL
This helps us share USB ports from a Windows machine to it's WSL Linux

### Use `adb` on WSL for debugging the Qualcomm
* `adb kill-server` to kill running adb servers (need to do this often)
* `adb devices` to see connected devices
* `adb shell` to log into the Qualcomm device

Leverage [Qualcomm's Sample AI Python scripts](https://docs.qualcomm.com/bundle/publicresource/topics/80-70015-50/python-sample-applications.html)

In WSL, start vscode from WSL, go to the Qualcomm extension and Application configuration multimedia to see the sample projects

### Setup ESP32 with Hardware Controls
* Connect ESP32 (USB-C) to the Qualcomm's USB-A port
* Set the Qualcomm's USB Port's baudrate to 115200: `stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0 115200`
* Listen to the output on the serial port: `cat /dev/ttyUSB0`

### Setup the Qualcomm to detect and classify objects with AI
* Connect Qualcomm's USB-C to a Windows machine's USB-A
* Use `usbipd` to share the Window's USB-A port with the Window's WSL
* In WSL Linux, ensure you can see the device with `adb devices`
* Log into the Qualcomm's shell environment with `adb shell`
* Connect the Qualcomm to the same network as the Redis Server machine `nmcli device wifi ...`
* Push the `run_detection.sh` onto the Qualcomm device using the `adb push` command
* Run the `run_detection.sh` bash script to start the Qualcomm AI Object Detection
* The script will pipe the AI detection data to the Redis Server
* If you need to remove carriage returns `^M` run the sed command to remove them `sed -i 's/\r//g' <script name>`

### Setup the Redis Server on the Qualcomm
* `docker pull redis` on Qualcomm to pull the docker redis server image
* `docker run --name redis --net host --hostname redis -d redis:latest redis-server --loglevel notice` to run the docker Redis Server
* Make sure the Redis Server machine and the Qualcomm are connected on the same network
* `docker exec -it redis redis-cli` to enter the container, then `ifconfig` to get the ip of the container
* Update start_sending_detections.sh to send the host to `127.0.0.1`
* Verify Redis is working by running `redis-cli` then in the CLI, type `ping`. You should see `PONG`
* Also to verify: `PSUBSCRIBE Detection::yolonas::0`, if start_sending_detections2.sh is running on Qualcomm, you should be able to see incoming json data for the detections

### Setup the Unity Project
* Download and build the Unity project
* Connect the VR Headset or deploy the project to an XR device like a phone
* Run the Unity executable
* Connect to the Redis Server
